About
=====

Multi Firefox Launcher allows you to easily launch more than one version of Firefox at the same time on any Mac OS X computer.

Installation
=====

* Download two versions of Firefox and place them in the same folder, naming them differently. By default the script looks in the /Applications/Browsers folder and looks for a "Firefox 3.0.x.app" naming pattern.
* [Add a new profile](http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Managing+profiles) for each version of Firefox you've added. By default the script looks for a "ff_3_0" profile naming pattern.
* Edit "Multi Firefox Launcher" using "/Applications/AppleScript/Script Editor", updating the rootPath and ffSuffixes variables appropriately.
* Optionally, while still in Script Editor do a Save As and choosing the "application" File Format. This will let you double-click the script to run it and is perfect for dropping in your Dock.

Usage
=====

* Double-click Multi Firefox Launcher.
* If Script Editor starts, click the "Run" button.
* Pick a version of Firefox to use.
* Enjoy.
